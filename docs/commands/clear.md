# Clear Command
##Info
The `clear` command allows you to remove messages in a particular channel in bulk.

The minimum amount of messages you can delete is 2. Currently, there is no maximum, but I wouldn't recommend deleting loads of messages at a time.

**This is a level one command.**

##Usage
* NOTE: Required Parameters = <> and Optional Parameters = []

* Usage: `{prefix}clear <messagesToDelete>`

##Aliases
* `purge`
